    <h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>
    <p>From western Philadelphia I hail
    where in my youth I'd play upon the green
    'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd
    by ruffians contemptible and mean.
    Although the spat was trivial and brief,
    it wounder my dear other deep within;
    and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,
    she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.
    When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,
    I came upon a coachman most unique;
    and yet, I simply took the trip and paid, price
    despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.
    I survey all the land with princely mien
    in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene. </p>
